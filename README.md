# Python script for generating 3D orthogonal non-woven textile in TexGen

TexGen is open source software licensed under the General Public License developed at the University of Nottingham for modelling the geometry of textile structures. TexGen has been used by the Nottingham team as the basis of models for a variety of properties, including textile mechanics, permeability and composite mechanical behaviour.

The purpose of this Python file is to create a 3D orthogonal non-woven CFRP textile that can be exported as a voxel mesh from TexGen, imported into Abaqus and simulated using periodic boundary conditions with the help of the Abaqus plug-in EasyPBC (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00366-018-0616-4).
